# How to write an Algorithm

            Algorithm Swap(a,b)
            {
                temp = a 
                a = b
                b = temp
            }


## How to Analyze an Algorithm
### 1. Time
        How much time is it taking
        Must be time efficient.
### 2. Space
        How much memory does it consume
### 3. Network or Data consumption
        How much data is transfered
        Can it be reduced or compressed?
### 4. Power consumption

### 5. CPU Registers does it consume
