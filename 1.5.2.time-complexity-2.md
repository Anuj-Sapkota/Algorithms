    for (i = 1; i < n; i = i * 2)
    {
        stmt; 
    }

    
### Explanation

the increments = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ....  = $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, ..., 2^k$

the loop will executes upto when i >= n;

at that time the i is $2^k$, Thus:

or, $2^k >= n$

or, $2^k = n$

or, $k = (log_{2}(n))$

This the time complexity is **$O(log_{2}(n))$**

Now the number of times the statement will execute is **$log(n)$**, but this gives decimal value, Now we need to know if we want to **floor** or **ceil** this value.

*We always use ceil*

    for (i = n; i >= 1; i=i/2)
    {
        stmt;
    }

Assume, i < 1 (Case upto which the for loop runs)

now, at last, i = $n/2^k$

so, $n/2^k$ = 1

or, n = $2^k$

or, k = $log_2(n)$

so, the order is $O(log_2(n))$

    for (i = 0; i * i < n; i++)
    {
        stmt;
    }

This will execute for $i^2$ = n timees, or, i = $\sqrt{n}$

order is $O(\sqrt{n})$


    for (i = 0; i< n; i++)
    {
        stmt ----------------------------> n times 
    }

    for (j = 0; j < n; j++)
    {
        stmt ----------------------------> n times
    }

So, the time function is $n + n = 2n$

Or the order is $O(n)$
